# Twitter Case Study: Leveraging Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis on Climate Change-Related Tweets
Please be advised that, in compliance with project confidentiality requirements, I am unable to disclose the code used in this project publicly. However, I am more than willing to discuss the project's methodology, outcomes, and provide general insights without revealing specific code details

# Context 
In the face of an apparent rise in skepticism surrounding climate change, companies that promote themselves as environmentally friendly or provide eco-conscious products face a challenging situation if they neglect thorough market research. To enhance ongoing market research endeavors, the development of a Machine Learning model becomes imperative. This model should be capable of discerning whether individuals believe in climate change or not, drawing insights from their unique tweet data.

# Dataset
The collection of this data was funded by a Canada Foundation for Innovation JELF Grant to Chris Bauch, University of Waterloo. The dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43,943 tweets were collected. Each tweet is labelled as one of 4 classes, which are described below.

Class Description :

- 2 News: the tweet links to factual news about climate change

- 1 Pro: the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change

- 0 Neutral: the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change

- -1 Anti: the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change Variable definitions
